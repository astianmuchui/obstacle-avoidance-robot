# Basic Obstacle Avoidance Using Ultrasonic sensors 

## Introduction 
A project was proposed to make a Robocar that should detect obstacles and avoid them using arduino uno.

## Solution 
Make the default motion to forward motion while the desired distance limit has not been reached, <br>
If the immediate obstacle is at the limit distance from the car , it turns left and right and checks which side has a less distance to an obstacle therefore avoiding it, 
This is recursive and repeats until there is a clear path
